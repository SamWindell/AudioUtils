# AudioUtils
### Command line utilities for manipulating audio samples

These are very simple programs that I have written to edit audio samples for use in a sampler. There are no external dependencies. To build from source, run CMake to generate your preferred build tool configuration (Visual Studio Solution, makefile, etc.).
