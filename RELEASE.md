Changes:
- Improved the quality of the fix-pitch-drift command
- Added a command to embed-sample-info to remove metadata
- Fixed a bug that would cause an assertion in the WAV metadata reader

There are experimental binaries available for the Windows, Linux and Mac versions of Signet. These can be found in the assets section of this Github release. Just download and extract the file to start using it.

In all likelihood, **the Mac version will not run** due to it not being codesigned or notarized. Deploying software on Mac often requires these extra steps.
